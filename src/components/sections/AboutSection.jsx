            Hello <StyledEmoji>ðŸ‘‹</StyledEmoji>
          </StyledHeading>
          <p>
            My name is Maura Joglekar.  I'm originally from Mexico, lived in Colorado during my school years and now live in California.

          Most recently,  I worked at F5 as a principal frontend developer in two different products building them from the ground up. 
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>As part of the F5 Cloud services, I was a main contributor for the login flow, account management, subscription flows, services onboarding, and the billing enablement. 
 </li>
 <li>
 As part of the NGINX product, I was the only frontend lead in the Analytics platform team building beautiful analytics dashboards to help customers identify, diagnose and solve issues.   

 </li>
          </ul>

           <p>
             Prior to that, I worked at Oracle as a experienced developer.  I was granted a patent for one of my projects and I worked closely with their biggest customer of that product to migrate billions of documents using that patented feature. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I have great collaboration and communication skills that enabled me to work well with product management, quality assurance, and backend engineers. I am very passionate about ensuring a good customer experience and I take extreme pride in my work. I also enjoy mentoring junior developers and interns.
